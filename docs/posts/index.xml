      <description>A Glance of AI How to say Hi in Klingonese?  In this section a task and corresponding AI system will be designed.
 Klingonese is an artificial alien language, every word of which is well documented and can be easily looked up by Star Trek fans. But when we&amp;rsquo;re faced with real Aliens, in like 100 years, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to listen to languages we&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of before. We&amp;rsquo;ll know nothing about the vocabulary, grammar, or structure, and we&amp;rsquo;ll have no family or root languages to compare to.</description>

      <description>ImageNet The first thing that amazed me was that the project of ImageNet took full advantage of WordNet and benefited from Mechanical Turk. In this way, the data is so organized by synonym sets and, sounds crazy, human-annotated. The data can be looked up easily through treemap visualization.
While each syntex, as claimed, has more than 1000 images on average to be illustrated, I still found some weak portions. With only 138 picture for People section, a lot of subdivisions, including business people and lobby boy, have no photos.</description>

      <description>I, Avatar Hundreds of Avatar making softwares are there for tuning our digital representations as the expectations. Specialized softwares like Adobe Fuse and MakeHuman; Sculpting softwares like Cinema4D and blender; Social media like Facebook and twitter; Mobile apps like Memoji and Kapu&amp;hellip;
Here I used Fuse (beta) and Kapu, a newly released app by Tencent (the largest game company on the planet), created two very distinguishable Avatars of me, and analyzed the differences.</description>
