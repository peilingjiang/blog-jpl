How could we, as physical computing beginners, use simple physical hacks to interpret this slight movement into analog signal?\nMy idea is to use copper tape, cut it into thin lashes, and attach them on upper and down eyelids.\nProcess The property of copper tape lays in somewhere between rigid and soft, making it really hard to cut or curved, while easy to bend (unintentionally) or scratched.\n  Even when cut nicely, the process of tearing the copper tape off its base will destroy every effort. After countless tries, I finally figured out a way to avoid it:\n Tear off two pieces of uncut tapes, one should be slightly longer than the other; Stick them together on the glued side; Cut; Curve the lashes.  Then the lashes would be more doable and won\u0026rsquo;t stick to each other when eye\u0026rsquo;s closing, since the sticky sides have been hidden inside.\n  Then I tried to use conductive ink (silver) to open a pathway on my face to hide the wire connecting point back on my neck. If it worked, I could further make conductive tattoo out of it. However, it\u0026rsquo;s useless - skin textures break the ink into tiny unconnected pieces. It took me another hour to wash them off and I had to switch back to tape again to wire from my eye to neck.\n  Conductive Ink\n  \n  Copper Tape\n  \nFinal Work Your browser does not support the video tag.\r\r"},{"idx":1,"href":"/posts/","title":"Posts","content":""},{"idx":2,"href":"/posts/performative-avatars/i-avatar/","title":"I, Avatar","content":" I, Avatar Hundreds of Avatar making softwares are there for tuning our digital representations as the expectations. Specialized softwares like Adobe Fuse and MakeHuman; Sculpting softwares like Cinema4D and blender; Social media like Facebook and twitter; Mobile apps like Memoji and Kapu\u0026hellip;\nHere I used Fuse (beta) and Kapu, a newly released app by Tencent (the largest game company on the planet), created two very distinguishable Avatars of me, and analyzed the differences. While both of them are 3D software, Fuse is more for 1:1 human body making, and Kapu is more like a canvas for preschool animation.\nKAPU As the visual character making iOS app for the instant message tool QQ (targeting younger generations), Kapu is social oriented, infantilized, and silly in some perspectives. It\u0026rsquo;s not for any serious sculpting, but minimizing the making process by preset designs and limited adjustable features. Authenticity is the least to be considered in this ACG world. But honestly, the process is quite playful and pleasing, with several features worth mentioning:\n\n  \n Maniac/Interactive Motions  Every time the user switch back to the character page, (it)\u0026rsquo;ll maniacally wave Hi to you with exaggerate gestures. Unlike traditional static Avatar making software, the whole process is more like an interactive game instead of a tedious sculpting work with the embedded motion features. While waving seems childish, corresponding feedback after the user changes a particular part helps highlight the adjustment and strengthen the \u0026ldquo;gaming\u0026rdquo; experience. For example, a blink after choosing an eye type.\n     On-body Adjustment  The most important thing for a mobile Avatar app targeting kids is usability: understandable and usable for anyone who has no modeling experience. Putting clear control points on the body, instead of using sliders, Kapu is very easy and straightforward to use. This feature is also quite similar to the Liquify section in Photoshop CC.\n   Avatar in the House  As a beginner level Avatar creator, the app doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer many parameters to be changed, and the whole process is heavily based on picking from preset haircut, facial features and clothing - can be purchased in the online market. The market is also serving for another feature of the app: My Space. The Avatar can not only stand on the grey plain floor, but also be realtime rendered into a room that can be decorated and visited by the user\u0026rsquo;s friends.\n  Social Avatars Avatars are never apart from a society as humans can never. And I can see Kapu\u0026rsquo;s attempt to build digital citizenship for younger users - and once the group formed, they shall never leave. When those physical characteristics will not only be seen by the users themselves but also their QQ friends and even anonymous people, users start to hesitate, and choices disobey their interests. Tencent\u0026rsquo;s using anime and infantilized to make it easy: You can never go wrong with a cute smiling character. Actually, the community culture of QQ, started 20 years ago in 1999, plays an important role in the anonymity trend of China\u0026rsquo;s Internet, with which as the mainstream communication tool, people got used to not use self photos as profile photo, and use made-up names instead of real names.\nFuse Beta \n  \nIn contrast, Fuse is a very serious tool: detailed and cooperated with Adobe suite and Mixamo for further productions. While it\u0026rsquo;s also based on picking from some very limited preset templets, it also offers a great many of sliders for users to customize the face, body, and texture. The user can then choose from another very limited library of ugly clothes.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\r\rAlthough there\u0026rsquo;re tons of parameters for users to adjust, templets as the base are all western faces. And I spent 30 minutes to just get it a little closer to my Asian looking.\nIdeas Quick notes of suggestions for Avatar making software.\n Aging:The models from Fuse look too mature for me, and adjusting the dimensions or length of eyes and nose manually is tedious. Since we\u0026rsquo;ve already have age recognizing models that could tell an approximate number based on a photo, is it possible for a Machine Learning based model help us generally adjust facial features? And compile the whole process into a slider: from 0 to 99 years old.

[1] This line comes from Mark Weiser’s The Computer for the 21st Century. The article from almost 30 years ago opened my eyes to the realm of computing with bringing up Virtual Reality and the “Pad” that you can grab and use anywhere. We never question writing, math, or other information technologies, nor the necessity of their education. We don’t notice them. They are simplified and compiled in ways that are so natural, ubiquitous, accessible for everyone, and thus as invisible as air. In consequence, the industry of computer science, as the driving force of the development of computing, should still be a promising industry for another decade. Since we’re still prototyping it.\nHowever, we shall not be worried about the aftermath. Keeping a diary is nothing like writing a story, and mathematicians and physicians are cracking Wall Street. While the technology itself will be packaged to be understood by the rest of us, people who master this to-be-essential knowledge still out-stand. With that being said, learning high school CS should eventually become something as normal as learning high school math. MIT has recently established a new college of computing [2], with a group of new joint majors which basically combine every existing major with computer science, e.g. biology and computer science. The trend of generalization of computing is exposed, again, through the lens of education.\n== Better Life? Are our lives being better out of technologies? I might have an unpopular answer. It is undoubtful that, even compared to 20 years ago, the ways of which we absorb information has became times faster, more convenient and accessible. All thanks to information technology. One easy opposing of it is that, getting informed more doesn’t logically nor practically equals to a better life. As Neil Postman argued in his article, tons of prominent problems, social justice, starvation, violence, hatred, etc., are still unsolved, even we can, and we know we can solve them.\nThe illusion of cure of insufficient information make our life looks better. But the truth might be the reverse. In fact, the rapid development of technology might contribute to class solidification and make the gaps in the society worse: When the technology starts to benefit the majority, it always has already benefited some specific groups of people several years ahead. Given this time due to the difficulties of popularization, or intended postponement, the faster and more powerful it’s developing, the greater the gap will be.\nOn the other hand, by the time it’s normal, it becomes normal. “Blue-collar computing” is inevitable, and is becoming the truth. We’re lucky to be more educated and qualified than people before, while facing with much more fierce competition. Our feelings stay the same, or become even worse. And “how people feel” is the only factor that should be taken into consideration when calculating the life quality.\nRelated Readings  It’s more than just “teach kids to code” Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change Program or be Programmed: Ten Commands for a Digital Age  Reference  Mark Weiser. 1991.
