**Week Two Assignment** / Look up the frequencies in a geographic location of your choice.

I decided to look up the radio frequencies around Waikiki Beach (HI, 96815) that I went to during the Winter recess. It turns out that there's not many different frequencies in Honolulu County so that I had to look at the *Education* section in the result. More specifically, different campuses of University of Hawaii. However, another problem occurred that licenses of frequencies in both Honolulu Community College (`WOFH280`) and Kapiolani Community College (`WQVC487`) are not well documented in the system and I failed to retrieve the information for them. At last, I found ones for the rest three campuses:

|                           | Frequency | License | Type | Tone    | Alpha Tag    | Description                                                 |
