## How to say Hi in Klingonese?

> In this section a task and corresponding AI system will be designed.

Klingonese is an _artificial_ alien language, every word of which is well documented and can be easily looked up by Star Trek fans. But when we're faced with real Aliens, in like 100 years, we'll have to listen to languages we've never heard of before. We'll know nothing about the vocabulary, grammar, or structure, and we'll have no family or root languages to compare to. In this case, we could use AI as a fast learner.

There'll be three stages:

1. **Learn**<br>
AI could learn a language in a very different way. It doesn't need to care about memory and searching. While we learn by words and grammars, AI can learn it as a whole through scenario-based conversations: we would have AI observe our friendly neighbor aliens and record their everyday life and communication (with their consent). Then AI would pare specific scenarios and the sentences. After a large amount of training, it would know about the language from common daily usage, to professional phrases.

2. **Documentation**<br>
Then AI will learn about how we document current languages: how dictionaries are formed, how to write example sentences, and how to build records, etc. AI will help us document the alien language in a way human can easily understand and lookup.

3. **Teach**<br>
Finally, AI will learn how current languages are taught, as design textbooks and class materials accordingly. And we'll get access to those languages we could never understand before.

***

**Actually, while alien language seems too imaginary, a lot of languages on this planet are endangered due to lack of documentation and proper sufficient usage. We could also use the process and system above as a remedy.**

### Summary

- Inputs: Recordings of conversations, articles, documents in the target language.
- Outputs: The language explain in known languages.
- Training Data: Need to be collected.
- Ethical Considerations: Since it'll be a full-time recording, the privacy has to be the first thing to be considered. Data will be all made anonymous. The participants will be able to decide when to stop the recording and can exclude any piece of recording out of the database.
