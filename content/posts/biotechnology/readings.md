# CRISPR

> This is a quick note of CRISPR, a topic to familiarize and workshop in class.

**CRISPR is changing how we do science.** (Phillip Sharp)

- **What** *Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats* is a family of DNA sequences found within the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea.

	*Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)* is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence.

	Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as *CRISPR-Cas9* that can be used to edit genes within organisms.

	The *CRISPR-Cas system* is a prokaryotic immune system that confers resistance to foreign genetic elements such as those present within plasmids and phages that provides a form of acquired immunity. RNA harboring the spacer sequence helps Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins recognize and cut foreign pathogenic DNA. Other RNA-guided Cas proteins cut foreign RNA. CRISPR are found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.

- **How** Researchers create a small piece of RNA with a short"guide" sequence that attaches (binds) to a specific target sequence of DNA in a genome. The RNA also binds to the Cas9 enzyme. As in bacteria, the modified RNA is used to recognize the DNA sequence, and the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA at the targeted location. Although Cas9 is the enzyme that is used most often, other enzymes (for example Cpf1) can also be used. Once the DNA is cut, researchers use the cell's own DNA repair machinery to add or delete pieces of genetic material, or to make changes to the DNA by replacing an existing segment with a customized DNA sequence.

	CRISPR-Cas9 is proving to be an efficient and customizable alternative to other existing genome editing tools. Since the CRISPR-Cas9 system **itself is capable** of cutting DNA strands, CRISPRs do not need to be paired with separate cleaving enzymes as other tools do. They can also **easily be matched with tailor-made “guide” RNA** (gRNA) sequences designed to lead them to their DNA targets. Tens of thousands of such gRNA sequences have already been created and are available to the research community. CRISPR-Cas9 can also be used to target multiple genes simultaneously, which is another advantage that sets it apart from other gene-editing tools.

- **Who** First discovered in archaea (and later in bacteria) by Francisco Mojica, a scientist at the University of Alicante in Spain.

CRISPR genome editing allows scientists to quickly create cell and animal models, which researchers can use to accelerate research into diseases such as cancer and mental illness. In addition, CRISPR is now being developed as a rapid diagnostic. To help encourage this type of research worldwide, Feng Zhang and his team have trained thousands of researchers in the use of CRISPR genome editing technology through direct education and by sharing more than 40,000 CRISPR components with academic laboratories around the world.

# Week Two

A high school student is cloning DNA at home. A former NASA scientist is live streaming experiments in his garage. A marketplace called Science Exchange is selling cloned DNA fragments that, potentially, could be used for both good or ill. All these facts are pointing to one clue: we are inevitably coming closer and closer to an era where most bio knowledge and experiments are decentralized and accessible for everyone. Community labs are awesome and form an unreplaceable piece of $370 billion bioeconomy. But we cannot ignore another fact as well: Keoni Gandall, the high-schooler, gained his fellowship in Stanford after experiments in his home, and Josiah Zayner, the former NASA scientist, worked for the government department and is still active in acknowledged academia conferences. People always say opportunities and possibilities in bio in this century are as promising as those in cyber industry from the past decades (and much much more). And after years of compiling and simplifying, coding is easy enough for everyone to learn and do. However, while "professional" programming education is now available from Youtube to summer schools, "research" labs are still only among the top tire universities. Similarly, what we should expect from the increasing community labs might be the introductory courses and accessible equipment that would bring more people into the field.
