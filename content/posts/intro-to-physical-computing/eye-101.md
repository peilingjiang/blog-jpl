# Eye 101

> If you want to know more about how to make fake lashes from copper tape, keep reading : )

When asked to make a switch, the first thing came into my mind was EYE - the hard-working switch turning on and off, or in other words, blinking, for 1,4000 times a day.

Current blink detection methods rely on CV. How could we, as physical computing beginners, use simple physical hacks to interpret this slight movement into analog signal?

My idea is to use copper tape, cut it into thin lashes, and attach them on upper and down eyelids.

## Copper Tape and Silver Ink

The property of copper tape lays in somewhere between rigid and soft, making it really hard to cut or curved, while easy to bend (unintentionally) or scratched.

Even when cut nicely, the process of tearing the copper tape off its base will destroy every effort. After countless tries, I finally figured out a way to avoid it:

- Tear off two pieces of uncut tapes, one should be slightly longer than the other;
- Stick them together on the glued side;
- Cut;
- Curve the lashes.

Then the lashes would be more doable and won't stick to each other when eye's closing, since the sticky sides have been hidden inside.

Then I tried to use conductive ink (silver) to open a pathway on my face to hide the wire connecting point back on my neck. If it worked, I could further make conductive tattoo out of it. However, it's useless - skin textures break the ink into tiny unconnected pieces. It took me another hour to wash them off and I had to switch back to tape again to wire from my eye to neck.

## Final Work

Though the circuit is closed and the little light bulb flashes as the eye blinks, its light is so weak and hard to distinguish. It is because there're so many connecting points along the circuit:

  power -- wire, wire -- tape, tape -- lash, lash -- another lash, another lash -- tape, tape -- wire, wire -- ground

And many of these connections are unstable, creating huge resistance. Power loses along the way. For the future works, it's a good case study to minimize the number of connection points and thus the energy loses. Also, straight tapes across the face look stylish in the first several minutes, but quite uncomfortable and lack of aesthetics. I'll try to use other types of conductive ink (e.g. Bare) and apply simple shapes or graph to either tape or ink.
