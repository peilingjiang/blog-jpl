Trolley problem might be the most famous and widely discussed dilemma in ethics and psychology. Here the author uses illustration to tell us what decisions we are actually making, or for the self-driving cars to make. With graphics instead of words, readers have a greater empathy with the ethical dilemma and gain a deeper understanding of how scary it could be for algorithms to decide for us. I also appreciate the fact that it doesn't allow you to change a made decision (unless you refresh the whole page) since that's exactly what the reality is - once it's done, there's no way back.

The visualization illustrates how the earthquake and tsunami affected the region. Its success lies in the visual impact and interactivity. Instead of using numbers, illustrations, or words, the editors objectively present the untouched pictures to the readers, as in this case, the **fact** itself is stronger and more impactful than anything else. Moreover, the whole presentation and information are interactive. While we see tons of interactive visualization these days, most of them has a slider or textbox aside, with which users can only interact with the body indirectly. Here, however, the slider bar is placed right at the middle of the images, allow users to interact with it directly to better understand how powerful the disaster was.

Essentially, it's _just_ a scatter plot, while with 3D modeling (with details including the nationality of the athletes), the clear narrative, and smooth animation, it efficiently explains how we run faster and better since 1896, as a result of better nutrition, equipments, and training skills. Thanks to the dynamic viewport, viewers will be able to see the graph from various angles to learn different information that might need a dozen of different plots to visualize. I also love how they "visualize" 3 seconds that today's gold medalist runs faster than that from more than 100 years ago - a pause of 3 seconds.
