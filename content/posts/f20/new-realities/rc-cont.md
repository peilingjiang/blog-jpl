**WIP**

This week, we try to use Reality Composer to design and prototype for experiences in day-to-day activities.

## RRR

**RRR stands for re-buy, refill, and repair.** With AR and object detection, users will be able to interact with the daily objects on-site and finish purpose-driven activities within the following friendly 2D interface.
