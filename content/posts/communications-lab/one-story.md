# One Story

-- Reflection on Chimamanda Ngozi Adichieâ€™s TED talk [1].

Making one story the only story might be dangerous, but inevitable.

It's true that each press, media, or storyteller might have their own perspectives, but it's also true that they are all under certain meta narratives [2]. Social media have granted us countless resources of information, but we still feel the cyberspace bias. We could imagine looking into a mirror broken into pieces reflecting the world around, the reflection will be different but not much if all of them are on one flat floor. It's also true for stories. Meta narrative can be our culture, history, political standpoints, fairy tales told from childhood, Shakespeare's drama, etc. All these built up individual narrative systems and as a consequence, constrain our stories into a pool.

Another stakeholder involved in story telling cannot be ignored as well: It's also about what we choose to believe as listeners. Most people just unconsciously believe everything they read or hear. Most of the rest only believe things they want to believe, with bias and prejudice. It's hard to tell which circumstance is worse, cause either of which are more or less falling into the trap of meta narrative.

In my opinion, it's fine to have just one story, as it's how most of our world is running on. More importantly, we can have a story that is embracing more than one point of view and allowing critic. Netflix's recent documentary American Factory is a good example. What makes a single story dangerous is not that there's not a second one, but the very only one is manipulated based on the storyteller's interests. If so, it's useless to have more stories since we're just jumping from one lie to another. Or it could be even more dangerous as people are comforted to have more fake options. One story could have multiple perspectives, and we just choose not to.

- Is there free will?
- Is telling partial truth lying?s
